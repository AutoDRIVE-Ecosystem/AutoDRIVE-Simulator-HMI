Human Machine Interfaces to AutoDRIVE Simulator

![Framework](Media/Framework.jpg)

This repository uses [AutoDRIVE Ecosystem](https://autodrive-ecosystem.github.io/) to realize an immersive digital twin framework for exploring human-autonomy coexistence. The source repository for AutoDRIVE Ecosystem can be found [here](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE).

**Observation Interfaces:**
- Single Monitor
- Triple Monitor
- XR Headset

**Interaction Interfaces:**
- Keyboard
- Mouse/Trackpad
- Gamepad
- Driving Rig

In terms of observability, users can choose between different cameras, which allow first-, second-, and third-person viewing. These viewpoints can either be statically rendered on a single/triple-monitor display or dynamically rendered within a mixed-reality framework, which allows for a fully immersive user experience. For interaction, the input methods are mapped across varying scales and configurations of vehicles to allow intuitive control for user convenience. A detailed video highlighting various human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to observe and interact with the autonomy-oriented digital twins in AutoDRIVE Simulator is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_cwrw1w5d_g?feature=shared).

## User Study

We administered the immersive presence of 16 users within the virtual environment of the proposed framework using the Bob G. Witmer Presence Questionnaire (PQ) [[25]](https://doi.org/10.1162/105474698565686), [[26]](https://doi.org/10.1162/105474605323384654). The questionnaire is made available as [Presence Questionnaire.xlsx](User%20Study/Presence%20Questionnaire.xlsx) and the user demographics are recorded in [Demographics.xlsx](User%20Study/Demographics.xlsx). Individual user responses for various observation and interaction interfaces are stored as `CSV` files within the [`User Study`](User%20Study) directory and are post-processed using the [data_analysis.mlx](User%20Study/data_analysis.mlx) script. Following are the post-processed user experience analyses for observation and interaction interfaces:

In order to evaluate the serviceability of the proposed framework, an edge-case urban driving scenario was devised. The scenario was laid out to jump-scare the ego vehicle and analyze its reactive response to the event. Particularly, the ego vehicle was supposed to keep driving straight unless it was unsafe/unethical to do so (e.g. dead end, traffic sign, traffic light, imminent collision, etc.). Down the road, a semiautonomous virtual vehicle was set up to cut across the ego vehicle as it approached the first 4-way intersection, requiring the ego vehicle to execute a panic-breaking maneuver while ensuring safety in case of any failures.

The individual runs for distinct modes of operation (AV, CAV, HV-S, and HV-D) are stored within the [`Case Study`](Case%20Study) directory and are post-processed using the [data_analysis.mlx](Case%20Study/data_analysis.mlx) script. The following plot depicts the ego vehicle behavior in autonomous (AV), connected autonomous (CAV), human-operated with static HMD (HV-S), and human-operated with dynamic HMD (HV-D) modes of operation:
